<p>The Qt Metrics web portal visualizes the status and progress of Qt's quality, focusing on Continuous
Integration (CI). The goal is to automate laborious manual work that is required, for example, in the CI
release cycle, to report the key information in real time. The Qt integration teams (in The Qt Company)
and the global Qt developer community are the target audience. For detailed description, see the
<strong><a href="https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_Metrics_2_Description" target="_blank">wiki page</a></strong>.</p>

<p>In case of questions, proposals, and improvement ideas, please contact the
<strong><a href="https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_Metrics_2_Description#SUPPORT" target="_blank">development team</a></strong>.</p>

<p>See the <strong><a href="https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_Metrics_2_Backlog" target="_blank">backlog</a></strong>
for development items currently identified or in progress.</p>
