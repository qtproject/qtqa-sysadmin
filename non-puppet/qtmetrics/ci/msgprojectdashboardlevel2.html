                                         By default, the latest Build data is shown, but any listed Build can be selected by clicking the build number.
                                         The Timescale filtered and/or the Build selected is indicated.<br>

                                         the count and ratio of failed Autotests by significance with the number of reruns for the latest build,
                                         and the count and ratio of failed and successful builds compared to total for each Configuration
                                         (either based on all data in the database or according to the Timescale filter i.e. based on the builds done after the selected date).<br>

                                         Builds with insignificant tagging should be analyzed, especially if there are several failed significant Autotests.
                                         High count, ratio or number of reruns of failed Autotests indicates a need for analysis.
                                         High ratio of failed builds compared to successful builds indicates a need for analysis.
                                         <i>Note: The ratio may not be an ideal measure when the total count of builds is low.</i><br>
