=head1 NAME

20-puppet-tests.t - run puppet system tests

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  perl t/20-puppet-tests.t [test1 [test2 ...]]

Runs "puppet --noop" over some tests. A test is a .pp file located under a
"tests" subdirectory of a puppet module.

By default, all tests in the current repository are run. If additional
arguments are passed on the command-line, they are interpreted as regular
expressions; only the tests whose filenames match the given tests will be
run. This makes it easy to run all the tests for a specific module (e.g.
C<perl t/20-puppet-tests.t /baselayout/> to run all tests for 'baselayout'
module).

=head1 CREATING A TEST

The most basic test simply instantiates one or more resources of a given type.
For example, modules/quux/tests/config.pp might instantiate a quux::config
item:

  # basic verification that quux::config doesn't crash
  quux::config { "test config":
      path => "/etc/quux/quux.conf",
      key => "Name",
      value => "Quux number 1",
  }

This tests at least that puppet is able to instantiate resources of the given
type without any fatal error. This is superior to a syntax check only, because
it will detect error conditions such as unsatisfiable or circular dependencies.

Using the selftest::expect type defined in this repository, it is also possible
to perform some verification on the output generated by puppet. For example:

  quux::config { "test config":
      path => "/etc/quux/quux.conf",
      key => "Name",
      value => "Quux number 1",
  }

  selftest::expect { "creates /etc/quux and /etc/quux/quux.conf":
      output => [
        # regular expressions; output must match all of these, in this order
        'File\[/etc/quux\]',
        'File\[/etc/quux/quux\.conf\]',
      ]
  }

The above test will succeed only if 'puppet apply --noop' exits with a zero
exit code _and_ does something with File[/etc/quux] and
File[/etc/quux/quux.conf] (in that order). This is a superior test than not
verifying any output at all, but it is difficult to be more precise than
"does something" when verifying the output because the output of puppet is
not designed to be parsed in this way.

=head1 PERMISSION PROBLEMS

Typically, puppet is run as root, but clearly that is not desirable for running
these tests.

Most puppet code will work fine in --noop mode regardless of whether or not
puppet is running as root; however, a few things (e.g. an 'exec' resource with
a 'user' parameter other than root) will abort if puppet is not running as root,
even in --noop mode.

In this case, this script will attempt to run puppet with the 'fakeroot'
utility, which pretends to be root. If fakeroot is not available, any test
which appears to need root permission will be skipped.
