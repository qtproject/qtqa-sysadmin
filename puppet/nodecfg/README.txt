This directory should contain one or more configuration files defining the
puppet setup to be applied to this machine.

A configuration file can be generated interactively by running:

  nodecfg.pl -interactive

All files in this directory matching *.yaml will be concatenated, in alphabetical
order of filename, then used as an external node specifier according to the syntax
documented at: http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/external_nodes.html

It is possible to combine the generated configuration file with additional configuration
files, such as in the following example:

  # 10-config.yaml, generated by nodecfg.pl -interactive;
  # configures the machine as a CI tester
  classes:
    ci_tester:
      icecc_enabled: true
      icecc_scheduler_host: ""
      testuser: qt

  # 99-environment.yaml, written by hand, sets "development" puppet environment
  # (as opposed to default "production")
  environment: development
