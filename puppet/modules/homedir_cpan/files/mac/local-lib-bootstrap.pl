=head1 NAME

local-lib-bootstrap.pl - download and install local::lib into $HOME/perl5 on mac

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # install local::lib version 1.008004 into $HOME/perl5
  $ ./local-lib-bootstrap.pl 1.008004

This is a simple script to automate bootstrapping of local::lib into $HOME/perl5.
Currently it is intended for use on mac (only), as other platforms should have a more
robust way to install local::lib (e.g. the system package manager).

This script absolutely _must not_ use any perl module which is not available by default
with the system perl 5.10 install available on OSX 10.6.
