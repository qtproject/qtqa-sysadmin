### Note! This is a hack deployed by Qt QA.
###
### We must block the boot process until the machine really has
### discovered its hostname - KDE session breaks if hostname changes
### during startup.
###
### This achieves the blocking by sourcing our maybe_wait_for_real_hostname
### script from /etc/default/locale, which itself is sourced by some
### important init scripts, in particular the kdm script.
