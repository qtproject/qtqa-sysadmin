# On Ubuntu (and probably other distros), although an init script
# may have `Required-Start: $networking', the hostname may not be accurately
# set until later.

# them, so this script is provided so that those daemons can delay startup
# until the real hostname is known.

# If we're starting kdm through upstart, or we're starting _anything_ through
# SysV-style init script...
